    "# Introduction\n",
    "The search algorithms that we have seen so far are designed to explore search spaces systematically. This systematicity is achieved by keeping one or more paths in memory and by recording which alternatives have been explored at each point along the path. When a goal is found, the path to that goal also constitutes a solution to the problem. In many problems, however, the path to the goal is irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the path to the goal does not matter, we might consider a different class of algorithms, ones that do not worry about paths at all. Local search algorithms operate using a single current node (rather than multiple paths) and generally move only to neighbors of that node. Typically, the paths followed by the search are not retained. Although local search algorithms are not systematic, they have two key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThey use very little memory—usually a constant amount.\n",
    "2.\tThey can often find reasonable solutions in large or infinite (continuous) state spaces for which systematic algorithms are unsuitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to finding goals, local search algorithms are useful for solving pure optimization problems, in which the aim is to find the best state according to an objective function. Examples of local search algorithms are:\n",

We will use the Traveling salesman problem who needs to visit a number of cities exactly once before returning to the first.

If at some point no neighbour is better than the current solution, it returns the then current solution."

Let's create a single-argument function called nCities, which indicates the number of cities we want in our Traveling salesman issue. The issue generator can then just loop over nCities times, each time producing a new list of distances (distances). Except where the value is already known: when the loop is adding the distance of the city to itself (which should be zero), and when it is adding a value it has already calculated, such a distance list can be filled with random numbers.This is the case when the algorithm adds the distance from city B to city A after previously adding the distance from city A to city B, despite the fact that these distances should be the same. In comment 1 and 2 from the code below this criteria is met."

The movement of goods from a transportation center, such as a depot or warehouse, to the end customer's preferred delivery method is referred to as last mile delivery.
